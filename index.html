  		 You have become my favorite habit. From threatening me with 'No uterus, no opinion' to being the 'Handsome 21-year-old' in your office lore—life is just infinitely more fun with you.
   		 You are lovable in every way. 
 		 I can't wait to see you. We can get that Sitaphal icecream, even if my stomach is full. I just want to be with you.
                Yearning to be in your arms.
    I promise to always listen to your 'ashleel' movie reviews, and never let you run out of white noise for your flight. <br><br>
    Will you be my Valentine?"
